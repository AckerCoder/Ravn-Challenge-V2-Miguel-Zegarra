  <h3 align="center">Hi! This is a challenge made by Miguel Zegarra for Ravn</h3>

  <p align="center">
    The challenge was about of building an app with GraphQL, Apollo and other optional technolgies. The app is a Star Wars Character Registry powered by https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/ I have chossen ReactJS for a bunch reasons, but the most important is because it's very simple to compile and do some changes while you are working with an API.
